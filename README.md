Deployment of Prefect Flow
work_queue_name is used to submit the deployment to the a specific work queue.
You don't need to create a work queue before using the work queue. A work queue will be created if it doesn't exist.
from prefect.deployments import Deployment
from prefect.orion.schemas.schedules import IntervalSchedule
from datetime import timedelta

deployment = Deployment.build_from_flow(
    flow=main,
    name="model_training",
    schedule=IntervalSchedule(interval=timedelta(minutes=5)),
    work_queue_name="ml"
)

deployment.apply()
Running an Agent
$ prefect agent start --work-queue "ml"
